# Hi, I'm Eric

I am finishing my Masters in _Informatics: Programming & System architecture_ from the University of Oslo (UiO), and will be done by Autumn 2025.

<br/>

## Highlighted Projects

<br/>

### Thesis
I am writing my thesis about improving the experience of scRNA-seq analysis, and developed a tool called SCRY (Single-Cell Rendering & Yield) for biologists with a non-technical background.

Repository: [SCRY](https://github.com/EricSvebakk/SCRY)

<br/>

### Part-time Work
I worked part-time as a full-stack developer on the MESHR-project in 2025. MESHR is a network-analysis tool which aims to make legal knowledge more interactive and inclusive.

The codebase is currently private, but the tool itself is public.

### Volunteering
I volunteered as the Tech Lead at Cybernetisk Selskab in 2024. My main contribution was leading the development of a new website/platform for volunteers at the Bar/Café, Escape.
