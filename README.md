# Hi, I'm Eric

I am finishing my Masters in _Informatics: Programming & System architecture_ from the University of Oslo (UiO), and will be done by Autumn 2025.

## Thesis
I am writing my thesis about improving the experience of scRNA-seq analysis, and developed a tool called SCRY (Single-Cell Rendering & Yield) for biologists with a non-technical background.

You can find the tool here: [SCRY](https://github.com/EricSvebakk/SCRY)

If you have any questions about the tool or would like to contribute, you can reach me at: ericatsvebakk@gmail.com
