## âœ¨ Hello and welcome to my page âœ¨

<br>

My name is Eric, and here's some notable things about me:
- I am studying for a Master's Degree in Informatics: Programming & System architecture, at the University of Oslo
- I am currently living in Berlin as a part of an Erasmus foreign exchange
- I consider volunteer work to be fun/important, so I am volunteering as the system administrator for [Cybernetisk Selskab](https://github.com/cybernetisk)
- If you go to [tepohi.no](https://tepohi.no), you will find my current hobby project. I am developing a new system for the other volunteers at CYB ðŸ’š
- Feel free to contact me if you have an interesting project which could use another person! ðŸ™Œ
